Locations were downloaded from the Movebank.org data repository on `r today`.

Data were not filtered before plotting. All locations received during each duty cycle were included. Two weeks of data prior to the date the data were downloaded are shown.

The oldest transmitter location timestamp in this map is `r min_date`.

The most recent transmitter location timestamp in this map is `r max_date`.

`r location_count` locations from `r ptt_count` transmitters are shown in this map

Sea ice concentration data from University of Bremen are from `r yesterday`.

Hover the cursor over a point to show information related to that location. 

Select the background map from menu in upper-right corner (sea ice concentration or satellite image).

Select the most recent 2 weeks of locations (red points) or most recent 2 days (1 duty cycle) of locations (yellow points) in the upper right corner.

Data on sea ice concentration from the University of Bremen are available [here](https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/data/amsr2/today/Beringstrait_AMSR2_visual.png).

Information on remotely sensed sea ice data is [here](https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/fileadmin/user_upload/ASIuserguide.pdf)
